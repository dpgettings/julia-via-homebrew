julia-via-homebrew
==================

A record of what (I think) it took me to install Julia from source on my Macbook Pro running OSX 10.6.4

### Running
Here is how I ran the script:

```
$ source install_script.sh
```

That is, I ran it with `source` rather than with the usual method. This was to make (extra) sure that it executed in the local shell environment/scope -- I didn't want to miss any potentially important environment variables.
